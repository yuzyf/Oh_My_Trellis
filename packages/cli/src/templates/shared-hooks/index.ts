/**
 * Which shared hooks each platform actually invokes. Single source of truth
 * for shared-hook distribution — both `writeSharedHooks` (runtime install)
 * and `collectSharedHooks` (`trellis update` diff) read from this table.
 *
 * Routing rules encoded here:
 * - `session-start.py` — shipped by every platform with a SessionStart
 *   hook event *except* codex + copilot, which bundle a platform-specific
 *   session-start.py under their own template dirs.
 * - `inject-workflow-state.py` — every platform with a UserPromptSubmit
 *   (or equivalent) event. Kiro + codex self-included; platforms without
 *   per-turn main-session hooks are excluded.
 * - `inject-subagent-context.py` — class-1 (push-based) platforms only.
 *   Class-2 (pull-based) platforms (codex, copilot, gemini, qoder) can't
 *   have hooks mutate sub-agent prompts — their sub-agents load context
 *   via a prelude instead.
 * - Kiro supports per-turn + spawn hooks on both surfaces (per the official
 *   docs https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/hooks/): the CLI custom agent declares
 *   `hooks.userPromptSubmit` + `hooks.agentSpawn`, and the IDE declares a
 *   `.kiro.hook` with `when.type=promptSubmit`. So Kiro ships
 *   `session-start.py` (agentSpawn overview), `inject-workflow-state.py`
 *   (per-turn breadcrumb), and `inject-subagent-context.py` (sub-agent
 *   spawn). The scripts emit a plain-text Kiro branch — Kiro adds a hook's
 *   stdout directly to the conversation context (no JSON envelope).
 * - Claude Code `statusLine` is intentionally not installed by default.
 *   Users can add their own statusLine command in `.claude/settings.json`,
 *   or opt in to the Trellis one via `trellis init --with-statusline`
 *   (installed from `templates/claude/hooks/`, not from this table — no
 *   other platform has a statusLine event).
